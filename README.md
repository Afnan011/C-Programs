## About Me

Hi there! I'm Afnan, and I'm passionate about programming and technology. I'm currently starting to learn the C programming language, and I'm excited to share my journey with others who are also interested in learning this powerful language. I believe that coding is a valuable skill that can help us solve real-world problems and create innovative solutions. With this in mind, I'm eager to continue my learning and expand my skillset in this field.

Feel free to follow along with my progress and reach out if you have any suggestions or recommendations for me. Let's learn and grow together!
